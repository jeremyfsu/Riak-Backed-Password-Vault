Riak Backed Password Vault

This is mostly a project to help me learn about Riak,
a no-sql distributed document database.  Also, I will be learning
how to use riak-javascript-client which is a javascript client for Riak.

INSTALLATION:
1. Install a working Riak server and start it.
2. Run install.sh, this uses curl to deposit the index.html and JS libraries into a
a bucket named "vault"
3. Point your browser to: http://localhost:8098/riak/vault/index.html

NOTES:
Your passwords are stored in a bucket called "passwords" and are encrypted with
256 bit AES (the default for GibberishAES). Other levels of AES are available,
see the Gibberish documentaion on GibberishAES for details.

Currently re-writing to make use of SugarSkull and MicroJungle, a routing engine and a templating engine 
respectively.  I found both of these on microjs.com.

Also adding the ability to list the accounts and enabling "one-click" decryption. 

Other things I'd like to add next:
1. JSON in the body rather than free text, abstracted to the UI with a form, fields would be username, password, 
notes?
2. Passphrase timeout - blanks your passphrase field after a few minutes in case you leave your computer 
unattended.
3. Styling - make it look purty!
