Riak Backed Password Vault

This is mostly a project to help me learn about Riak,
a no-sql distributed document database.  Also, I will be learning
how to use riak-javascript-client which is a javascript client for Riak.

INSTALLATION:
1. Install a working Riak server and start it.
2. Run install.sh, this uses curl to deposit the index.html and JS libraries into a
a bucket named "vault"
3. Point your browser to: http://localhost:8098/riak/vault/index.html

NOTES:
Your passwords are stored in a bucket called "passwords" and are encrypted with
256 bit AES (the default for GibberishAES). Other levels of AES are available,
see the Gibberish documentaion on GibberishAES for details.

I'm currently re-writing this and making use of SugarSkull, a JS routing library, and MicroJungle, 
a JS templating library.  I'm also adding the ability to list the contents of the password bucket 
and have "one-click" decryption.
