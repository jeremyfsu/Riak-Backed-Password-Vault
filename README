Riak Backed Password Vault

This is mostly a project to help me learn about Riak,
a no-sql distributed document database.  Also, I will be learning
how to use riak-javascript-client which is a javascript client for Riak.

INSTALLATION:
1. Install a working Riak server and start it.
2. Run install.sh, this uses curl to deposit the index.html and JS libraries into a
a bucket named "vault"
3. Point your browser to: http://localhost:8098/riak/vault/index.html

NOTES:
Your passwords are stored in a bucket called "passwords" and are encrypted with
256 bit AES (the default for GibberishAES). Other levels of AES are available,
see the Gibberish documentaion on GibberishAES for details.

I'm going to deploy a Riak server on my laptop as well as my desktop, and attempt to
link them up. Ideally I'd like to be able to store passwords at my desktop, and
retrieve them from my laptop and vice versa. My laptop's IP can change, so will Riak
sync up when my laptop is on the home LAN? Or can I expose my Riak DB to the internet
and my laptop find it at home?  I still need to learn more about Riak's distibuted features.

I think I might re-write this app to use Amazon S3, just for the academic benefit.
